## Hello World.

All of a sudden, I opened Tumblr and started my road on English blog.

Although Tumblr is some kinds of lightweight blog, I prefer to use it as a normal blog. Not something like twitter.

My Chinese Blog can be found at:

[LanternD's Castle](https://dlyang.me)

That would be my main blog, where I write my daily thought.

For here, I'm going to post anything related to my research, academics, or techniques in my major field. My English version research diary.

That's all. :)
